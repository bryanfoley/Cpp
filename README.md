This repository contains code in C++.
Using an efficient force summation technique,the Verlet List, we numerically model a 2D granular aggre-
gate in different geometries. Energy is added to the system as gravitational potential
energy or vertical vibration.
A 5th order Predictor-Corrector Gears Integration scheme is used to compute the properties of all soil particles in the system.

Some sample input files are included.
This is an ongoing work and updates will be developed in other branches and delivered periodically.
